## Overview

Calamity allows you to schedule three types of events:

- **Appointments**: Events with a start and end time.
- **Tasks**: Events with a deadline, like homework.
- **Chores**: Events meant to be performed on the day they're scheduled, such as hygiene tasks.

Events are selected using a coordinate system. Days are chosen with capital letters `A-Z`, and specific events within those days are chosen with numbers `1-9`.

Events can also be repeated daily, weekly, or monthly. Repeated events generally share characteristics like description, color, and time.
